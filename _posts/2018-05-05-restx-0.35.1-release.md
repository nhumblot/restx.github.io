Today we are very happy to announce release 0.35.1 of RESTX, the lightweight, modular, feature rich, blazing fast and 
open source Java REST framework.

## New and Noteworthy

This version is a `0.35` bugfix release aiming at fixing 2 things :
- Rolled back upgrade for jongo / mongo-java-driver / bson4jackson introduced in `0.35` as we met some major 
  regressions during this move (see [Pull Request #289 for precisions](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/289))  
  Details on version changes : 
  - `jongo@1.3.0` => `jongo@1.1`
  - `mongo-java-driver@3.4.0` => `mongo-java-driver@2.11.3`
  - `bson4jackson@2.7.0` => `bson4jackson@2.3.1`
- Fixing compilation errors when annotations with default values (like `@NotNull`) or `Class<PARAM>` field type were 
  used ont `RestxResource`s  
  More precision [on Pull Request #286](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/286)

## Getting started / Upgrading

Want to get started now? Check out the [related doc](/docs/getting-started.html).

Upgrading from an earlier version?

- in your projects you just need to update `restx.version` to `0.35.1` in your dependency descriptor
- in your code you might have to adapt to some breaking changes (see below)
- in the shell, run `shell upgrade` to upgrade your shell and plugins.

## MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES

Those breaking are likely to be hit by any existing RestX project. Consider those as a "migration guide" to apply on your project :
- [44084b7](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/44084b7) Downgraded mongo java driver from `3.4.0` to `2.11.3`
