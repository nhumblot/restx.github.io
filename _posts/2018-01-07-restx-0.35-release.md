Today we are very happy to announce release 0.35 of RESTX, the lightweight, modular, feature rich, blazing fast and 
open source Java REST framework.

## New and Noteworthy

### Better cold classes management ([PR #175](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/175))

Several new things have been added about cold classes :
- It permits to add inherited classes of `cold` components (components being loaded in the main factory, such as 
  `AutoStartable` ones) in cold classes list.
- It adds a way to declare `cold classes` using a property: `restx.cold.classes`. The property value is a list of 
  fqcn separated by `,`.
- It adds a way to declare `cold classes` using a resource file: `META-INF/cold-classes.list`. Resources will be 
  loaded from the classloader, and every classes listed will be added to the cold classes list. The file must contains 
  a list of fqcn, one per line.
- It provides a way to fulfil the resource file using a new annotation: `@Cold`. So every classes annotated with 
  `@Cold` will be added to the resource file.

### [breaking] Security roles are now interpolated ([PR #223](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/223))

Security roles used in `@RolesAllowed` annotation can now be interpolated with `query parameters` and `path parameters`.

For example :
```
@GET("/security/{companyId}/{subCompanyId}")
@RolesAllowed("EDIT_COMPANY_{companyId}_{subCompanyId}")
public String editSubCompany(String companyId, String subCompanyId){
    // ....
}
```

Also, you can add `wildcarded roles` to your principal, such as `EDIT_COMPANY_1234_*` : the special `*` in role name 
will match `any role parameter value` meaning users having role `EDIT_COMPANY_1234_*` will be able to call any 
`/security/1234/*` url without hitting any `403 FORBIDDEN` response.

This feature may be particularly of interest if you are able to generate the whole security roles attached to a user 
when he authenticates.
An example usage of such role definition & usage may be found in the `samplest`'s 
[`CompanyAndSubCompanyRoles`](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-samplest/src/main/java/samplest/security/CompanyAndSubCompanyRoles.java)
enum, [`SecuredResource`](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-samplest/src/main/java/samplest/security/SecuredResource.java#L21) 
and [`principals`](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-samplest/src/main/java/samplest/AppModule.java#L25) declarations.


### Unified and improved Query, Path and Body params handling ([PR #177](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/177))

`Query` & `Path` parameters are now both handled through `MainStringConverter`, itself based on `Jackson` 
registered deserializers.

It means you can now use the same deserializer for every types of parameters (initially, for instance, you were not able
to use `DateTime` in `PATH` parameters .. now you can). 

Also, `Aggregated types` are now handled in such parameters, like `List<BaseType>`, `Iterable<BaseType>` or `BaseType[]` 
(as soon as `SimpleType` is what we call a `BaseType`, that is to say a type which would represent a "single" value : 
an `Integer`, a `String`, a `Date` etc. which could be handled by `MainStringConverter` component)

Parameterized types handling (based on generics) in every types of parameters (`path`, `query`, `body`) have been 
greatly improved as well, supporting any level of generics.
For instance something like  
[`Map<Boolean, Map<Tuple<String,Tuple<Integer,Float>,String>,String>>`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core-annotation-processor/src/test/java/restx/annotations/processor/TypeHelperTest.java#L49)
would not generate a compilation error during annotation processing.

`Optional` support has been improved on parameters :
- allowing to take generics parameterized types (like `Optional<List<Long>>`)
- `Body` content and `Path` parameters can now be `Optional`
- as before, non-`Optional` parameters are implicitely mandatory, no matter its parameter type

For the internals, parameters deserialization are now handled by dedicated `@Component`s which implement the
[`EndpointParameterMapper`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/endpoint/mappers/EndpointParameterMapper.java)
interface.
A factory component ([`EndpointParameterMapperFactory`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/endpoint/mappers/EndpointParameterMapperFactory.java)
with [`DefaultEndpointParameterMapperFactory`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/endpoint/mappers/DefaultEndpointParameterMapperFactory.java)
default implementation) is responsible to guess the appropriate `EndpointParameterMapper` which will be used for 
deserialization depending on target type to deserialize. 
This guessing is made only once during `Route` construction (so that there is no performance impact during request processing).

Currently, 3 `EndpointParameterMapper` are provided by `DefaultEndpointParameterMapperFactory` :
- [`BaseTypeEndpointParameterMapper`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/endpoint/mappers/BaseTypeEndpointParameterMapper.java) : 
  mapper used to handle `BaseType` which may be handled by `MainStringConverter` (jackson-based) component
- [`BaseTypeAggregateEndpointParameterMapper`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/endpoint/mappers/BaseTypeAggregateEndpointParameterMapper.java) :
  mapper used to handle an `Aggregate` of `BaseType`s. Supported `Aggregate`s for this release are `Iterable`, `List`, 
  `Set`, `Collection` and `Array`
- [`ComplexTypeEndpointParameterMapper`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/endpoint/mappers/ComplexTypeEndpointParameterMapper.java) :
  mapper used to handle complex (POJO) types. However, this component is not implemented yet (we'll keep this 
  implementation for next RestX release, see [#248](https://github.com/restx/restx/issues/248))

Also, if you want to recover old RestX 0.34 behaviour, we provided a `LegacyEndpointParameterMapperFactory` and a
`LegacyEndpointParameterMapper` which are not taken into account by default (due to their priority compared to above component).
If you want to re-enable it, simply change their priority and you will get back `0.34` parameters deserialization handling.

Because of those important changes, if you implemented your own `StdEntityRoutes`, you will likely have to change
a lot of stuff :
- you will have to pass a `EndpointParameterMapperRegistry` and declare an array of `ParamDef`s in `StdEntityRoute`'s constructor
  those `ParamDef` attributes represent parameter metadata used by `EndpointParameterMapperFactory` to guess `EndpointParameterMapper`.
- you will have to resolve input endpoint parameter differently: have a look at a generated `ResourceRouter` class taking the same parameters
  in order to know how to handle those input endpoint parameters.

### Request Header params and annotation aliases ([PR #277](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/277))

A new `@Param` annotation kind has been introduced : `Kind.HEADER` allowing to inject request headers into your `@RestxResource`'s
endpoints.

As other `@Param` annotations, you can either use `@Param`'s value field for header name 
(`@Param(value="X-My-Header", kind=Kind.HEADER)`) or implicitely use parameter variable name, even if it is unlikely to
work properly : header names start with an uppercase which is not fitting Java variable naming best practices, and dashes
are used as word separator whereas dashes are forbidden in Java variable names.

New annotation have been introduced aliasing different types of common `@Param` annotation kinds :
- `@HeaderParam("foo")`, aliasing `@Param(value="foo", kind=Kind.HEADER)`
- `@QueryParam("foo")`, aliasing `@Param(value="foo", kind=Kind.QUERY)`
- `@PathParam("foo")`, aliasing `@Param(value="foo", kind=Kind.PATH)`
- `@ContextParam("request")`, aliasing `@Param(value="request", kind=Kind.CONTEXT)`


### Producing endpoint annotations metadata and making it available at runtime

Annotations attached to any `@RestxResource` endpoint will be transposed to `OperationDescription.annotations` new field
attached to target endpoint.

This opens a lot of possibilities as the `OperationDescription.annotations` will be retrievable at runtime as soon as
you have an `StdEntityRoute` instance in hand, typically in `RestxFilter`s.

It would allow to create any custom endpoint annotation, specific to your project, and implement your own custom behaviour 
around this custom annotation in a custom `RestxFilter`.

An `EntityRelatedFilter` useful superclass has been provided to help implementing such `RestxFilter` with some
commodity. You can have a look at [ExpiresHeaderFilter](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/response-headers-management/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/http/ExpiresHeaderFilter.java)
or [LocationHeaderFilter](https://github.com/fcamblor/restx/blob/response-headers-management/restx-core/src/main/java/restx/http/LocationHeaderFilter.java)
for examples on such `Filter` implementations.


### `@ExpiresAfter` and `@LocationHeader` new annotations, and injecting `RestxResponse`

2 new annotations have been added to manage some frequently used response headers.
Those annotations handling are using the new `OperationDescription.annotations` field we talked about above and are aimed
at giving you some examples if you decide to implement your own `Response Headers` management.

`@ExpiresAfter` annotation allows to generate an `Expires` response header. It can be used this way :
```
    @GET("/expires")
    @ExpiresAfter("2d 4h")
    public String expireHeader() {
        return "hello";
    }
```

`@LocationHeader` annotation allows to generate a `Location` response header. It can interpolate fields from entity
returned by your endpoint, and can use special `_baseUri_` and `_currentUri_` variables.
It can be used this way :
```
    @POST("/foos")
    @LocationHeader("{_currentUri_}/{id}") // Resolved to /api/foos/{id}
    public Foo locationHeader(Foo foo) {
        foo.setId("123456");
        return foo;
    }

    @POST("/foos2")
    @LocationHeader("{_baseUri_}/headers/foos2/{id}") // Resolved to /api/headers/foos2/{id}
    public Foo locationHeader2(Foo foo) {
        foo.setId("123456");
        return foo;
    }
```

In the end, for easy custom response header management, you will be able to inject `RestxResponse` into your enpoints
by using `@Param(value="response", kind=Kind.CONTEXT)` special annotation.
This behaviour is clearly **discouraged** for several reasons :
- you're tainting your endpoint with Restx specific API (like you would do with `RestxRequest`)
- things you will do with `RestxResponse` instance will remain undocumented in api-docs
- with great powers comes great responsibilities : if you use `RestxResponse` API to write `response` body too early,
  it may lead to unwanted/unpredictable behaviour.

## Getting started / Upgrading

Want to get started now? Check out the [related doc](/docs/getting-started.html).

Upgrading from an earlier version?

- in your projects you just need to update `restx.version` to 0.35 in your dependency descriptor
- in your code you might have to adapt to some breaking changes (see below)
- in the shell, run `shell upgrade` to upgrade your shell and plugins.

## MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES

Those breaking are likely to be hit by any existing RestX project. Consider those as a "migration guide" to apply on your project :
- [9a93edf](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/9a93edf) `restx-server-jetty` artefact has been renamed to `restx-server-jetty8`
- [8475ee5](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/8475ee5) renamed `JettyWebServer` to `Jetty8WebServer`, same for module
  and properties (for instance, `restx.server.jetty.webxml.default.location` => `restx.server.jetty8.webxml.default.location`)
- [ba28876](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/ba28876) `Permissions` utility class has been replaced by 
  `PermissionFactory` component
- [ba28876](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/ba28876) `StdRestxSecurityManager` now takes a `PermissionFactory` in 
  its constructor, if you subclassed it, you will need to provide this component during construction (simply inject it 
  in your constructor).
- [ebac25e](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/ebac25e) `PATH` params are url-decoded by default; if you want to keep old
  behaviour, simply `@Provide @Named("restx.http.decode.url.path.params")` component valued to `false`
- Some libraries have evolved :
  - [2bab182](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/2bab182) upgraded guava from 17.0 to 18.0. See 
    [guava 18 release note](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release18).
  - [9e56b1f](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/9e56b1f) upgraded jongo from 1.0 to 1.3.0. See 
    [jongo release note](http://jongo.org/#release-notes).
    Worth noting in this upgrade is the compatibility with `mongo-java-driver 3.0` and the rename of some frequently used
    annotations : `@Id => @MongoId` and `@ObjectId => @MongoObjectId`
  - [1c07f87](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/1c07f87) [b1c4dd5](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/b1c4dd5) following jongo upgrade to 1.3.0, `mongo-java-driver` has been upgraded
    to `3.4` (see [compatibility matrix](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference/#java-driver-compatibility)) 
    and `bson4jackson` to 2.8.0.
  - [515d8e8](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/515d8e8) upgraded jackson from 2.3.3 to 2.8.10 
   ([latest `2.8.X` version](https://twitter.com/fasterxml/status/900597086793617408)).
    See [jackson release notes](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.8.10).
- If you implemented your own routes :
  - [58f190a](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/58f190a) `RestxRequestMatcher` should be passed to `RestxSecurityManager`
  - [4f61fd2](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/4f61fd2) considering a `StdEntityRoute` should *always* bring a 
    `permissionFactory` at construction time (simply inject it in your route and pass it to the `super` constructor)
  - [PR #177](https://github.com/restx/restx/pull/177) `StdEntityRoute` constructor and input parameters mapping have evolved
    (have a look at the `Unified and improved Query, Path and Body params handling` section)
- If you implemented your own `WebServer` :
  - [f24469d](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/f24469d) removed `serverId` useless field in both constructor and builder
  - [8f58414](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/8f58414) `TomcatWebServer` constructor now takes a bind interface
- [46f8b58](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/46f8b58) principal cached roles are now cleared upon logout; if you already
  were cleaning the roles, don't forget to remove this behaviour or implement your own [`SessionInvalider`](https://github.com/restx/restx/blob/restx-parent-0.35/restx-security-basic/src/main/java/restx/security/SessionInvalider.java)
  component for this purpose
- [8c14dff](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/8c14dff) `GET /sessions/current` returns `404 Not found` instead of 
  `200 OK` when no session is defined for current request
- [3db7d18](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/3db7d18) every graphite settings are now prefixed with `restx.` to avoid
  collisions with existing graphite properties potentially defined on your app server 


## MINOR BREAKING CHANGES

Those breaking changes are unlikely to happen as it is happening on very rare/specific cases.

Anyway, this is worth noting it in case you would be in those particular scenario :
- [460715b](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/460715b) `Name` are a `String+Type` instead of a `String+Class`
- [ceb7a5b](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/ceb7a5b) `FactoryMachine.nameBuildableComponents` uses `Type` (instead of `Class`)
- [58f190a](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/58f190a) if you implemented your own `RestxSecurityManager`, you will 
  have to update `check()` prototype to take a `RestxRequestMatcher`
- [f3e51cf](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/f3e51cf) if you implemented your own `Permission` implementation, you 
  will have to update `has()` prototype to take a `Map<String, String> roleInterpolationMap` parameter
- [f3e51cf](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/f3e51cf) if you relied on `Permissions` utility class, you will have 
  to pass an additionnal `Map<String, String> roleInterpolationMap` parameter to method calls
- [44e142c](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/44e142c) if you were using braces (`{}`) in your roles, those will 
  now be interpolated
- [2afa00b](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/2afa00b) if you provided your own `Messages` implementation, you 
  will have to provide an `Iterable<String> keys(Locale)` with same impl than `Iterable<String> keys()`
- [0576682](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/0576682) if you provided your own `MutableMessages` implementation, don't
  forget to invalidate cached keys when you mutate your `MutableMessages` instance (most of the time in `setMessageTemplate()`)
- [9effdfd](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/9effdfd) `ResourcesRoute` doesn't allow to serve resources from root
  classpath anymore, as it is considered a security flaw
- [489961d](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/489961d) using static classes for shell's `deps` command's subcommands 
  instead of instance classes
- [449b870](https://github.com/restx/restx/commit/449b870) `DELETE` endpoint parameters should be looked up in `QUERY` 
  param instead of `BODY` content when no `@Param` is provided (default behaviour)
